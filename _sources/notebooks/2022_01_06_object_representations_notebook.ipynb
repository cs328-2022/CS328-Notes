    "* Data science involves using scientific tools, algorithms and data models to statistically analyse and extract knowledge from large volumes of processed/unprocessed collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematically, an object can be represented in 2 ways:\n",
    "  * Object Representation: To depict isolated objects like vectors (words in a document), sequences (DNA), etc.\n",
    "  * Network Representation: To show interaction among objects like graphs (friendship network, road connections), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most common representation for documents is called 'bag of words' representation. \n",
    "  * First, the document sentences are tokenized. \n",
    "  * Then their base forms are derived via stemming and lemmatization.\n",
    "  * The collected lexemes are then converted to n-gram or skip-gram models. As n increases, the size of the word dictionary and thus, the memory required to store it increases, but contextual information is captured more efficiently.\n",

The objective is to minimise the cost associated with edit distance while modifying an entity. The higher the edit distance, the higher is the difference between the entities.\n",

    "Consider strings $A$ = 'brack' and $B$ = 'back'. We can delete the 'r' at the 2nd position to match the character 'a' at the 2nd position of $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Substitution (cost=1): Replacing a character in $A$ at the desired position $i$ so that the character at position $i$ of $A$ and $B$ match.\n",
    "Consider strings $A$ = 'herlo' and $B$ = 'hello'. We can substitute the 'r' at the 3rd position with an 'l' to match the characters at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit Distance for two strings $A$ and $B$ is the minimum cost of the mentioned operations to convert $A$ into $B$ or vice-versa.\n",

    "Similar to $L_p$ *norm* and *Jaccard Distance*, Edit Distance obeys all three mentioned metrics of distance functions.\n",
    "Let $d(x,y)$ be the edit distance (or minimum cost of operations) for two strings $x$ and $y$; defined as the cost to modify $x$ to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a) $d(x,x)=0$\\\n",
    "This is trivial as the minimum number of operations (and cost) to change string $x$ to $x$ is 0.\\\n",
    "b) $d(x,y)>0 \\iff x\\neq y$\\\n",
    "If $x$ is not equal to $y$, there will be atleast one operation with an associated cost $c_i$ required to change or modify $x$ to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$\\\n",
    "Consider the cost required to update $x$ to $y$ (or edit distance of $x,y$) is $c$. We can argue that the minimum cost required to update $y$ to $x$ is $c$ by replacing insertion with deletion, deletion with insertion for $d(y,x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $d(x,y)+d(y,z)\\geq d(x,z)$\\\n",
    "Let $d(x,y)=c_1\\;,\\; d(y,z)=c_2$. We can argue that $d(x,y)+d(y,z)< d(x,z)$ is FALSE. This can be done by contradiction. \\\n",
    "Let $d(x,y)+d(y,z)< d(x,z)$ with $\\;d(x,y)=c_1\\;,\\; d(y,z)=c_2$\\\n",
    "Or, $\\;c_1+c_2< d(x,z)$\\\n",
    "However, we can easily argue that we can update $x$ to $z$ by updating $x$ to $y$ and then updating $y$ to $z$. Since edit distance gives the minimum number of operations associated with the cost, $d(x,z)$ can be $c_1+c_2$ at max. Therefore, our assumption is wrong.\\\n",
