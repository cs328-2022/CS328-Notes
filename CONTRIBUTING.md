## How to Contribute:
1. [Create an account](https://github.com/) on GitHub if you do not already have one.
2. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/cs328-2022/CS328-Notes): click on the ‘Fork’ button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub user account. For more details on how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
3. Clone your fork of the CS328-Notes repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/CS328-Notes.git  # add --depth 1 if your connection is slow
cd CS328-Notes
```
4. Install the dependencies for building jupyter-book:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Add the `upstream` remote. This saves a reference to the main CS328-Notes repository, which you can use to keep your repository synchronized with the latest changes:
```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:cs328-2022/CS328-Notes.git
```
6. Check that the upstream and origin remote aliases are configured correctly by running git remote -v which should display:
```bash
origin  git@github.com:YourLogin/CS328-Notes.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:YourLogin/CS328-Notes.git (push)
upstream        git@github.com:cs328-2022/CS328-Notes.git (fetch)
upstream        git@github.com:cs328-2022/CS328-Notes.git (push)
```
7. Synchronize your `main` branch with the `upstream/main` branch, more details on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork):
```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
8. Create a feature branch to hold your development changes:
```bash
git checkout -b my_feature
```
and start making changes. Always use a feature branch. It’s good practice to never work on the `main` branch!
9. Install pre-commit to run code style checks before each commit:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
10. Develop the feature on your feature branch on your computer, using Git to do the version control. When you’re done editing, add changed files using `git add` and then `git commit`:
```bash
git add modified_files
git commit
```
to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:
```bash
git push -u origin my_feature
```
10. Follow below instructions to create a pull request from your fork.
It is often helpful to keep your local feature branch synchronized with the latest changes of the main CS328-Notes repository:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
Subsequently, you might need to solve the conflicts. You can refer to the [Git documentation related to resolving merge conflict using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line).

## Adding Pages to CS328-Notes book
1. Add the Markdown/IPYNB file in the `CS328-Notes/notebooks` directory.
2. In case the Markdown/IPYNB file import images/gifs/data-files, make sure to place the files in a new folder in assets directory `CS328-Notes\assets\<same-name-as-of-IPYNB-MD-file>`.
3. Add the filename to the Table to Content file `CS328-Notes/_toc.yml`.
4. Build the jupyter-book on your local machine using `jupyter-book build CS328-Notes`. The html output will be placed in `CS328-Notes/_build/html` and is for your reference only. The published html pages are generated automatically on github.

## Passing Checks on PR and preview
1. Make sure all the check pass in the Pull Request.
2. You can preview the temporary build of the pull request on web by clicking on `Details` link of `ci/circleci:build_jupyter_book artifact` check. This would how exactly the E-book would be once the pull request is merged.
3. Resolve the merge conflicts in PR, if any.
