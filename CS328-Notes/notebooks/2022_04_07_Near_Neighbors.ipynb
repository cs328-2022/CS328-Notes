    "1. Finding Similar Images in Search\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finding Near Duplicate Webpages/Articles - Specifically used in de-duplicating the websites. For eg:- While implemnting a search engine, we don't want multiple copies of the same article with only minor variations, so we perform de-duplication.\n",
