    "## Low rank approximation in Mixture Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixture model is a probablistic model where the distribution is sum of different probablity densities. Each of these proabablity densities have a weight in the distribution of the mixture model. In short a mixture model is a weighted sum of of probablity densities.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    P = w_1p_1 + w_2p_2 + w_3p_3 + . . . + w_kp_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* K is the number of distribitions present in the mixture model\n",
    "* $ p_i$ is the probablity density of the $i^{th}$ distribution\n",

    "In this section, we will only consider a gaussian mixture models in which each of the underlying probablity densities are sphereical gaussians.\n",

    "### Clustering of gaussian mixture model\n",
    "\n",
    "We had previously seen that in a gaussian mixture if the distance between centers  $ >cd^{1/4}$ then clustering algorithms will be able to identify points from the same distribution in gaussian mixture model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* d is the dimension of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In higher dimension, this seperation is usually not met and clustering algorithmns performs poorly.\n",
    "Now hypothetically if we are given the subspace spanned by the K centers then we can project all the sample points to this subspace.\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "* The distance between centers remanins same because we are projecting onto the subspacce which is spanned by the centers\n",
    "* The dimension of the data has decreased from d to k\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically $ k<<d $ and therefore the minimum distance between centers to distinguish their distribution has decreased. This is benifical for our clustering algorithms and will give us better performace.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the $\\underset{v}{\\operatorname{\\arg max}} {{{\\lVert Av \\rVert}}_2}^2$ approximately lies along ${\\overrightarrow{\\mu}}$ and from the previous lemma we can say that the unit vector along $\\mu$ can be approximated to the 1st singular vector\n",

    "* So to find the subspace spanned by ${[\\mu_1,\\mu_2,...,\\mu_n]}$ we need to find $\\underset{P}{\\operatorname{\\arg max  }}$  ${{{\\lVert AP \\rVert}}_F}^2$\n",
