    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Let's Explore the LSH usage in a large Documents Database</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>First we have to Vectorize the Document. To do that we build k-shingles. And then we make a big set of k-shingles and assign every shingle to an unique index</p>\n",

    "<p>Now we have a large document of NXD dimensions with N documents and D columns having values 1/0 representing differnet shinngles. But we can't work with that dense matrix.</p>\n",

A[0]!=B[0] which means the two are not similar and we return 0. Let's do the second shuffle. Shuffle gives A={0,0,1,1}, B={0,0,1,0}, so we get A[2]=B[2]!=0 which is a +1. Ultimately, if you shuffle enough times, you will find the similarity approaches the true value of 0.25. It is an approximation method that yields an expected similarity value. And more the data we have more the accuracy we'll generate.</p>\n",
