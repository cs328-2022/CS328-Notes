    "For the given Gaussian parameters, the likelihood function would imply the probability of the points $ x_1, x_2, …, x_k $ to fit the Gaussian family with the center μ and covariance matrix $\\sigma  ^2I$ . This probability is given by:  \n",

    "As a next step, it is important to understand the number of partitions that are to be created in order to achieve the desired cluster. The reason being that the performance of the algorithm for K-means clustering in the worst case would be bounded by the number of partitions.    \n",

    "\n",
    "We have seen that given a set of points and some specified centers, we have partitioned the data using Voronoi Partitioning.

In this case, which point would be the optimal center in each partition?   \n",
