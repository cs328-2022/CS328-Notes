    "* Data science involves using scientific tools, algorithms and data models to statistically analyse and extract knowledge from large volumes of processed/unprocessed collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematically, an object can be represented in 2 ways:\n",
    "  * Object Representation: To depict isolated objects like vectors (words in a document), sequences (DNA), etc.\n",
    "  * Network Representation: To show interaction among objects like graphs (friendship network, road connections), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most common representation for documents is called 'bag of words' representation. \n",
    "  * First, the document sentences are tokenized. \n",
    "  * Then their base forms are derived via stemming and lemmatization.\n",
    "  * The collected lexemes are then converted to n-gram or skip-gram models. As n increases, the size of the word dictionary and thus, the memory required to store it increases, but contextual information is captured more efficiently.\n",

    "Consider strings $A$ = 'brack' and $B$ = 'back'. We can delete the 'r' at the 2nd position to match the character 'a' at the 2nd position of $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Substitution (cost=1): Replacing a character in $A$ at the desired position $i$ so that the character at position $i$ of $A$ and $B$ match.\n",
    "Consider strings $A$ = 'herlo' and $B$ = 'hello'. We can substitute the 'r' at the 3rd position with an 'l' to match the characters at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit Distance for two strings $A$ and $B$ is the minimum cost of the mentioned operations to convert $A$ into $B$ or vice-versa.\n",

    "Similar to $L_p$ *norm* and *Jaccard Distance*, Edit Distance obeys all three mentioned metrics of distance functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. a) $d(x,x)=0$\\\n",
    "This is trivial as the minimum number of operations (and cost) to change string $x$ to $x$ is 0.\\\n",
    "b) $d(x,y)>0 \\iff x\\neq y$\\\n",
    "If $x$ is not equal to $y$, there will be atleast one operation with an associated cost $c_i$ required to change or modify $x$ to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$\\\n",
    "Consider the cost required to update $x$ to $y$ (or edit distance of $x,y$) is $c$. We can argue that the minimum cost required to update $y$ to $x$ is $c$ by replacing insertion with deletion, deletion with insertion for $d(y,x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $d(x,y)+d(y,z)\\geq d(x,z)$\\\n",
    "Let $d(x,y)=c_1\\;,\\; d(y,z)=c_2$. We can argue that $d(x,y)+d(y,z)< d(x,z)$ is FALSE. This can be done by contradiction. \\\n",
    "Let $d(x,y)+d(y,z)< d(x,z)$ with $\\;d(x,y)=c_1\\;,\\; d(y,z)=c_2$\\\n",
    "Or, $\\;c_1+c_2< d(x,z)$\\\n",
    "However, we can easily argue that we can update $x$ to $z$ by updating $x$ to $y$ and then updating $y$ to $z$. Since edit distance gives the minimum number of operations associated with the cost, $d(x,z)$ can be $c_1+c_2$ at max. Therefore, our assumption is wrong.\\\n",
