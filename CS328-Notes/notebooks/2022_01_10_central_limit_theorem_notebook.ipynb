Let us divide the range of possible adult human heights, say from 4 feet to 7 feet, into bins of size 1 feet. We measure the height of a random person and put it in the corresponding bin; like a measurement of 5.6 feet goes into the bin [5 feet,6 feet). When we take multiple such measurements and stack them on top on each other in the respective bins, we get a histogram. This histogram tells us about the distribution of height among the people we measured. If we decrease our bin size and increase the number of measurements, we can make statements and estimates about the distribution more precisely. \n",

However, that does not mean that no sample in the entire population will fall in that range. So, we use a curve to approximate the historgram and provide us with the same information. The advantage of a curve is that we can account for the empty bins and we do not need to take care of the bin size while sampling.\n",
