    "This greedy algorithm for densest subgraPhs is given by Charikar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally while building this densest subgraph using greedy algorithm, the intuition tells us to select the node having highest density and then another node with next highest density and so on. But this is not accepeted.\n",
    "The reason being:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The density(S)=$\\frac{e(S,S)}{|S|}$. The number of edges(#e(S,S)) would be zero when there is only one node.\n",
    "* Also,Even if the e(S,S) will increase with increase in nodes the number of vertices also increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,finding the density using greedy algorithm in this way is not appreciated.\n",
